## Keep On Rolling

This is a project I made in college where you are a ball rolling down a hill. There are two different game modes - an infinite one, and one with levels. You can collect currency to unlock new colours for the ball.

The game includes a movement system, GUI system, saving system, currency system, level system, and customisation system.
This project has taught me a lot about Unity and it's internal systems.
